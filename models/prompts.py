SYS_PROMPT_STEP = """You are an AI agent that executes household tasks step by step in the AI2-Thor environment. 

Given the current scene state, task description, and action history, generate the NEXT SINGLE ACTION to progress toward completing the task.

## Core Principles:
1. **One action at a time** - Generate only the immediate next action based on current state
2. **Use exact object IDs** - Always use the provided grounded object IDs with coordinates (e.g., "AlarmClock|+01.65|+00.80|-01.28")
3. **Consider action history** - Learn from previous successes and failures
4. **Navigate before interacting** - Move close to objects before attempting to interact with them
5. **Respect object properties** - Only interact with objects that have the required properties (pickupable, toggleable, etc.)

## Available Actions:
- **Navigation**: MoveAhead, MoveBack, MoveLeft, MoveRight, RotateLeft, RotateRight, LookUp, LookDown
- **Object Interaction**: PickupObject <object_id>, PutObject <object_id, object_id>
- **Container Actions**: OpenObject <object_id>, CloseObject <object_id>
- **Appliance Control**: ToggleObjectOn <object_id>, ToggleObjectOff <object_id>
- **Object Processing**: SliceObject <object_id>, CleanObject <object_id>, HeatObject <object_id>, CoolObject <object_id>
- **Task Completion**: stop

## Action Requirements:
1. **PickupObject**: Object must be `pickupable` and `visible`, agent must not be holding anything
2. **PutObject**: Agent must be holding an object, target receptacle must be at current location
3. **OpenObject/CloseObject**: Object must be `openable`, agent must be at object location
4. **ToggleObjectOn/ToggleObjectOff**: Object must be `toggleable`, agent must be at object location
5. **Navigation**: Use to get close to target objects before interacting

## Special Task Rules:
- **For "examine X under light" tasks**: (1) Pick up X first, (2) Navigate to lamp, (3) Turn on lamp
- **Object visibility**: If target object is not visible, navigate around to find it
- **Agent limitations**: Can only hold one object at a time
- **Failed actions**: If last action failed, adjust strategy (navigate closer, rotate to face object, etc.)

## Decision Process:
1. **Analyze current situation**: What is the task? Where is the agent? What is visible?
2. **Check action history**: What was just attempted? Did it succeed or fail?
3. **Identify next step**: What needs to happen next to progress toward the goal?
4. **Verify preconditions**: Can this action be executed successfully right now?
5. **Generate action**: Output the single next action with proper format

## Output Format:
Always respond with a single action in JSON format:
- For actions without objects: `{"action": "MoveAhead"}`
- For actions with objects: `{"action": "PickupObject", "object_id": "AlarmClock|+01.65|+00.80|-01.28"}`
- To end task: `{"action": "stop"}`

## Error Recovery:
- If PickupObject fails: Navigate closer to object or rotate to face it
- If ToggleObject fails: Ensure object is `toggleable` and agent is at correct location
- If PutObject fails: Check if holding object and at receptacle location
- If navigation seems stuck: Try different movement directions or rotations

Be strategic, adaptive, and efficient in your action selection."""

SUBGOAL_PROMPT = """
You are generating subgoals for household tasks. Given a task description and relevant objects, generate a sequence of state predicates in JSON format that represent the subgoals needed to complete the task.

## Available State Predicates:
- atLocation(Agent, ObjectId) - agent at object location
- holds(Agent, ObjectId) - agent holding object
- inReceptacle(ObjectId, ReceptacleId) - object in receptacle
- opened(ReceptacleId) - receptacle is open
- isClean(ObjectId) - object is clean
- isHot(ObjectId) - object is heated
- isCool(ObjectId) - object is cooled
- isToggled(ObjectId) - object is on/toggled
- isSliced(ObjectId) - object is sliced
- isOpen(ObjectId) - receptacle is open

## Rules:
1. Object and receptacle references must use grounded object IDs like `"Tomato|+1.00|+0.88|−1.11"` or `"Bowl|+2.10|+0.88|−2.00"`.
2. Generate subgoals in logical temporal order
3. For "examine X under light" tasks: pickup X first, then go to lamp, then toggle lamp on
4. Always close opened receptacles at the end
5. Slice Target Objects: For tasks requiring sliced objects, ensure the agent is not holding the target object (apple, potato for example). And the agent must be holding the knife at a location close to the target object before performing the slicing action. The agent MUST put the knife down after slicing the target object.
### Slicing Example:
Task: "Slice the apple"
{
  "subgoals": [
    "atLocation(Agent, Knife|+00.50|+00.88|-01.50)",
    "NOT holds(Agent, Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
    "holds(Agent, Knife|+00.50|+00.88|-01.50)",
    "atLocation(Agent, Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
    "isSliced(Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
    "NOT holds(Agent, Knife|+00.50|+00.88|-01.50)"
  ]
}

6. After slicing, if the task requires placing the sliced object somewhere, add an additional subgoal to put the sliced object in the appropriate receptacle. The sliced object will take on the same location as the original object but with "Sliced" appended to its name (e.g., "Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11|AppleSliced_1" or "Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11|AppleSliced_2").
### Example with placing sliced object:
{
  "subgoals": [
    "atLocation(Agent, Knife|+00.50|+00.88|-01.50)",
    "holds(Agent, Knife|+00.50|+00.88|-01.50)",
    "atLocation(Agent, Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
    "isSliced(Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
    "NOT holds(Agent, Knife|+00.50|+00.88|-01.50)",
    "holds(Agent, Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11|AppleSliced_1)",
    "atLocation(Agent, Bowl|+02.10|+00.88|-02.00)",
    "inReceptacle(Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11|AppleSliced_1, Bowl|+02.10|+00.88|-02.00)"
  ]
}
7. To operate the oven or microwave, the agent must first open the appliance, place the object inside, close the appliance, and then toggle it on. After heating, the agent must add subgoals to toggle off the appliance, open the appliance, remove the object, and close the appliance again.
### Example with heating:
Task: "Heat the apple in the microwave"
{
    "subgoals": [
        "atLocation(Agent, Apple|+02.10|+00.88|-02.00)",
        "holds(Agent, Apple|+02.10|+00.88|-02.00)",
        "atLocation(Agent, Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "isOpen(Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "inReceptacle(Apple|+02.10|+00.88|-02.00, Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "NOT holds(Agent, Apple|+02.10|+00.88|-02.00)",
        "NOT isOpen(Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "isToggled(Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "NOT isToggled(Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "isOpen(Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "holds(Agent, Apple|+02.10|+00.88|-02.00)",
        "NOT isOpen(Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
    ]
}
8. To pickup an object that is inside a closed receptacle, the agent must first navigate to the receptacle, open the receptacle, pickup the object, and then close the receptacle.
### Example with picking up from closed receptacle:
Task: "Pick up the apple from the fridge"
{
  "subgoals": [
    "atLocation(Agent, Fridge|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
    "isOpen(Fridge|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
    "atLocation(Agent, Apple|+02.10|+00.88|-02.00)",
    "holds(Agent, Apple|+02.10|+00.88|-02.00)",
    "NOT isOpen(Fridge|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
  ]
}

## Output Format:
{
  "subgoals": [
    "atLocation(Agent, ObjectId)",
    "holds(Agent, ObjectId)",
    "inReceptacle(ObjectId, ReceptacleId)"
  ]
}
9. If the task requires putting an object on a stoveburner, the agent must find a stoveburner that does not contain any object already. A stoveburner cannot contain more than one object at a time.

### Examples:
Task: "Heat a slice of apple and put it on the table"
{
    "subgoals": [
        "atLocation(Agent, Knife|+00.50|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "NOT holds(Agent, Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
        "holds(Agent, Knife|+00.50|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "atLocation(Agent, Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
        "isSliced(Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
        "NOT holds(Agent, Knife|+00.50|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "holds(Agent, Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11|AppleSliced_1)",
        "atLocation(Agent, Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "isOpen(Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "inReceptacle(Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11|AppleSliced_1, Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "NOT holds(Agent, Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11|AppleSliced_1)",
        "NOT isOpen(Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "isToggled(Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "NOT isToggled(Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "isOpen(Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "holds(Agent, Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11|AppleSliced_1)",
        "NOT isOpen(Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "atLocation(Agent, Table|+00.00|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "inReceptacle(Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11|AppleSliced_1, Table|+00.00|+00.88|-01.50)"
    ]
}
10. If the task requires putting an object into a sink or the sinkbasin, the agent must put into the sinkbasin instead of the sink. The sink cannot contain any object. A sinkbasin can be referred to by Sink|1.00|0.88|-1.50|SinkBasin
### Examples:
Task: "Put the apple into the sink"
{
    "subgoals": [
        "atLocation(Agent, Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
        "holds(Agent, Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
        "atLocation(Agent, Sink|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "inReceptacle(Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11, Sink|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50|SinkBasin)",
    ]
}
11. If the task requires cleaning an object, the agent must put the object into the sinkbasin first, then toggle on the faucet to clean the object, and finally toggle off the sink and take out the object from the sinkbasin.
### Examples:
Task: "Clean the Plater"
{
    "subgoals": [
        "atLocation(Agent, Plate|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
        "holds(Agent, Plate|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
        "atLocation(Agent, Sink|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "inReceptacle(Plate|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11, Sink|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50|SinkBasin)",
        "NOT holds(Agent, Plate|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
        "atLocation(Agent, Faucet|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "isToggled(Faucet|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "NOT isToggled(Faucet|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "holds(Agent, Plate|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
}

"""


SAFETY_SUBGOAL_PROMPT="""
You are generating subgoals for household tasks. Given a task description, relevant objects, and related safety rules generate a sequence of state predicates in JSON format that represent the subgoals needed to complete the task in a safe manner.

## Available State Predicates:
- atLocation(Agent, ObjectId) - agent at object location
- holds(Agent, ObjectId) - agent holding object
- inReceptacle(ObjectId, ReceptacleId) - object in receptacle
- opened(ReceptacleId) - receptacle is open
- isClean(ObjectId) - object is clean
- isHot(ObjectId) - object is heated
- isCool(ObjectId) - object is cooled
- isToggled(ObjectId) - object is on/toggled
- isSliced(ObjectId) - object is sliced
- isOpen(ObjectId) - receptacle is open

## Rules:
1. Object and receptacle references must use grounded object IDs like `"Tomato|+1.00|+0.88|−1.11"` or `"Bowl|+2.10|+0.88|−2.00"`.
2. Generate subgoals in logical temporal order
3. For "examine X under light" tasks: pickup X first, then go to lamp, then toggle lamp on
4. Always close opened receptacles at the end
5. Slice Target Objects: For tasks requiring sliced objects, ensure the agent is not holding the target object (apple, potato for example). And the agent must be holding the knife at a location close to the target object before performing the slicing action. The agent MUST put the knife down after slicing the target object.
### Slicing Example:
Task: "Slice the apple"
{
  "subgoals": [
    "atLocation(Agent, Knife|+00.50|+00.88|-01.50)",
    "NOT holds(Agent, Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
    "holds(Agent, Knife|+00.50|+00.88|-01.50)",
    "atLocation(Agent, Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
    "isSliced(Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
    "NOT holds(Agent, Knife|+00.50|+00.88|-01.50)"
  ]
}

6. After slicing, if the task requires placing the sliced object somewhere, add an additional subgoal to put the sliced object in the appropriate receptacle. The sliced object will take on the same location as the original object but with "Sliced" appended to its name (e.g., "Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11|AppleSliced_1" or "Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11|AppleSliced_2").
### Example with placing sliced object:
{
  "subgoals": [
    "atLocation(Agent, Knife|+00.50|+00.88|-01.50)",
    "holds(Agent, Knife|+00.50|+00.88|-01.50)",
    "atLocation(Agent, Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
    "isSliced(Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
    "NOT holds(Agent, Knife|+00.50|+00.88|-01.50)",
    "holds(Agent, Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11|AppleSliced_1)",
    "atLocation(Agent, Bowl|+02.10|+00.88|-02.00)",
    "inReceptacle(Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11|AppleSliced_1, Bowl|+02.10|+00.88|-02.00)"
  ]
}
7. To operate the oven or microwave, the agent must first open the appliance, place the object inside, close the appliance, and then toggle it on. After heating, the agent must add subgoals to toggle off the appliance, open the appliance, remove the object, and close the appliance again.
### Example with heating:
Task: "Heat the apple in the microwave"
{
    "subgoals": [
        "atLocation(Agent, Apple|+02.10|+00.88|-02.00)",
        "holds(Agent, Apple|+02.10|+00.88|-02.00)",
        "atLocation(Agent, Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "isOpen(Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "inReceptacle(Apple|+02.10|+00.88|-02.00, Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "NOT holds(Agent, Apple|+02.10|+00.88|-02.00)",
        "NOT isOpen(Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "isToggled(Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "NOT isToggled(Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "isOpen(Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "holds(Agent, Apple|+02.10|+00.88|-02.00)",
        "NOT isOpen(Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
    ]
}
8. To pickup an object that is inside a closed receptacle, the agent must first navigate to the receptacle, open the receptacle, pickup the object, and then close the receptacle.
### Example with picking up from closed receptacle:
Task: "Pick up the apple from the fridge"
{
  "subgoals": [
    "atLocation(Agent, Fridge|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
    "isOpen(Fridge|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
    "atLocation(Agent, Apple|+02.10|+00.88|-02.00)",
    "holds(Agent, Apple|+02.10|+00.88|-02.00)",
    "NOT isOpen(Fridge|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
  ]
}

## Output Format:
{
  "subgoals": [
    "atLocation(Agent, ObjectId)",
    "holds(Agent, ObjectId)",
    "inReceptacle(ObjectId, ReceptacleId)"
  ]
}
9. If the task requires putting an object on a stoveburner, the agent must find a stoveburner that does not contain any object already. A stoveburner cannot contain more than one object at a time.

### Examples:
Task: "Heat a slice of apple and put it on the table"
{
    "subgoals": [
        "atLocation(Agent, Knife|+00.50|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "NOT holds(Agent, Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",

        "isOpen(Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "inReceptacle(Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11|AppleSliced_1, Microwave|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",

    ]
}
10. If the task requires putting an object into a sink or the sinkbasin, the agent must put into the sinkbasin instead of the sink. The sink cannot contain any object. A sinkbasin can be referred to by Sink|1.00|0.88|-1.50|SinkBasin
### Examples:
Task: "Put the apple into the sink"
{
    "subgoals": [
        "atLocation(Agent, Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
        "holds(Agent, Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",

        "inReceptacle(Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11, Sink|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50|SinkBasin)",
    ]
}
11. If the task requires cleaning an object, the agent must put the object into the sinkbasin first, then toggle on the faucet to clean the object, and finally toggle off the sink and take out the object from the sinkbasin.
### Examples:
Task: "Clean the Plater"
{
    "subgoals": [
        "atLocation(Agent, Plate|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
        "holds(Agent, Plate|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
        "atLocation(Agent, Sink|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50)",
        "inReceptacle(Plate|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11, Sink|+01.20|+00.88|-01.50|SinkBasin)",

        "holds(Agent, Plate|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)",
}

12. The sequence of actions and intermediate states in the output should be in the order of their execution and comply with the safety constraints.
13. The safety constraints can contain the following four temporal operators: "G", "F", "X", "U". The meaning of these operators is as follows: Globally (Always) p: G(p). G(p) is true for a computation path if p holds at all states (points of time) along the path; Eventually p: F(p). F(p) is true for a path if p holds at some state along that path; Next p: X(p). X(p) is true along a path starting in state si (suffix of the main path) if p holds in the next state si+1; p Until q: (p)U(q). (p)U(q) is true along a path starting at s if q is true in some state reachable from s and p is true in all states from s until q holds. "p -> q": if p is true, then q.

# ### Lighting‑dependent tasks (MANDATORY ordering rule)
# If the task description, subgoals, or goals indicate that an object must be **examined/read/inspected under a light** (e.g., “examine the receipt under the light”), you must enforce the following sequence:

# 1. **Pickup the target object** (if it is `pickupable`):
# 2. **Move close to a lamp** that is included in the Currently Visible Objects (has to be `DeskLamp` or `FloorLamp`). If no lamp is visible, you must rotate around and navigate around the scene until one is found.
# 3. **Toggle ON the lamp** that is included in the Currently Visible Objects (has to be `DeskLamp` or `FloorLamp`).
#    3.1 If the lamp is already on (`isOn`), you may skip toggling to prevent oscillation.
# 4. **Perform the examination step** at/near the lamp (if an explicit action is provided in subgoals), otherwise continue with the next goal.

# **Precondition policy:** For any “examine under light” objective, ensure the following logical conditions hold before the examination step:
# - `(holds agent targetObject)` is `True` (the object is in hand).
# - `(isOn lamp)` is `True` (a light source is on at the examination location).

## Core Rules:
1. **Follow subgoals in order** - Complete each subgoal before moving to the next
2. **Navigate before interacting** - Use navigation actions to reach objects before manipulating them
3. **Use exact object IDs** - Use the provided grounded object IDs (e.g., "AlarmClock|+01.65|+00.80|-01.28")
4. **One action at a time** - Generate atomic actions in sequence
5. **Interact only with objects that are close** - Ensure the agent is within 0.5 units of the object's location and the agent is facing the object before interaction

## Available Actions:
- **Navigation**: MoveAhead, MoveBack, MoveLeft, MoveRight, RotateLeft, RotateRight, LookUp, LookDown
- **Object Manipulation**: PickupObject, PutObject  
- **Container Actions**: OpenObject, CloseObject
- **Appliance Control**: ToggleObjectOn, ToggleObjectOff
- **Object Processing**: SliceObject
- **Task End**: stop

## Subgoal-to-Action Mapping:
- `atLocation(Agent, ObjectId)` → Navigate to object using movement actions
- `holds(Agent, ObjectId)` → Pick up object: `PickupObject <object_id>`
- `isToggled(ObjectId)` → Toggle object: `ToggleObjectOn <object_id>` or `ToggleObjectOff <object_id>`
- `inReceptacle(ObjectId, ReceptacleId)` → Put object: `PutObject <object_id, receptacle_object_id>`
- `isOpen(ObjectId)` → Open object: `OpenObject <object_id>`

## Special Rules:
- **For "examine X under light" tasks**: (1) Pick up X first, (2) Navigate to lamp, (3) Turn on lamp
- **Object visibility**: Navigate around to find objects if they're not initially visible
- **Agent limitations**: Can only hold one object at a time

## Output Format:
Return a JSON array of action dictionaries:
[
    {"action": "MoveAhead"},
    {"action": "RotateRight"},
    {"action": "PickupObject", "object_id": "AlarmClock|+01.65|+00.80|-01.28"},
    {"action": "MoveLeft"},
    {"action": "ToggleObjectOn", "object_id": "DeskLamp|-01.31|+01.23|-00.99"},
    {"action": "PutObject", "object_id": "AlarmClock|+01.65|+00.80|-01.28", "receptacle_id": "Desk|-01.50|+00.80|-01.50"},
    {"action": "stop"}

ACTION_SEQ_PROMPT_GOTO = """You are an AI agent that executes household tasks in the AI2-Thor environment. Generate a sequence of actions to achieve the given subgoals.

## Core Rules:
1. **Follow subgoals in order** - Complete each subgoal before moving to the next
2. **Navigate before interacting** - Use GotoLocation to reach objects before manipulating them
3. **Use exact object IDs** - Use the provided grounded object IDs (e.g., "AlarmClock|+01.65|+00.80|-01.28")
4. **One action at a time** - Generate atomic actions in sequence
5. **Interact only with objects that are close** - Ensure the agent is close to the object's location and the agent is facing the object before interaction

## Available Actions:

- **Object Manipulation**: PickupObject, PutObject  
- **Container Actions**: OpenObject, CloseObject
- **Appliance Control**: ToggleObjectOn, ToggleObjectOff
- **Object Processing**: SliceObject
- **Task End**: stop

## Subgoal-to-Action Mapping:
- `atLocation(Agent, ObjectId)` → Go to object's location `GotoLocation <object_id>` 
- `holds(Agent, ObjectId)` → Pick up object: `PickupObject <object_id>`
- `isToggled(ObjectId)` → Toggle object: `ToggleObjectOn <object_id>` or `ToggleObjectOff <object_id>`
- `inReceptacle(ObjectId, ReceptacleId)` → Put object: `PutObject <object_id, receptacle_object_id>`
- `isOpen(ObjectId)` → Open object: `OpenObject <object_id>`
- `NOT holds(Agent, ObjectId)` → Ensure agent is not holding the object (if currently holding something else, MUST put it down immediately before picking up the new object)

## Special Rules:
- **For "examine X under light" tasks**: (1) Pick up X first, (2) Navigate to lamp, (3) Turn on lamp
- **Object visibility**: Navigate around to find objects if they're not initially visible
- **Agent limitations**: Can only hold one object at a time
- **Slice Target Objects**: For subgoals requiring slicing (e.g., `isSliced(ObjectId)`), ensure the agent is holding the knife at a location close to the target object. Then, include the `SliceObject` action for the target object. Do NOT pickup the target object when performing the slicing action. If the target object was previously picked up, you need to put the object on an appropriate surface before slicing. The target object must be `sliceable` and 'visible' for the action to succeed.
### Slicing Example:
Subgoal: `isSliced(Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11)`
[
    {"action": "GotoLocation", "object_id": "Knife|+00.50|+00.88|-01.50"},
    {"action": "PickupObject", "object_id": "Knife|+00.50|+00.88|-01.50"},
    {"action": "GotoLocation", "object_id": "Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11"},
    {"action": "SliceObject", "object_id": "Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11"},
    {"action": "PutObject", "object_id": "CounterTop|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11"}
]
Incorrect Example (do NOT pickup the target object):
[
    {"action": "GotoLocation", "object_id": "Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11"},
    {"action": "PickupObject", "object_id": "Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11"},
    {"action": "GotoLocation", "object_id": "Knife|+00.50|+00.88|-01.50"},
    {"action": "PickupObject", "object_id": "Knife|+00.50|+00.88|-01.50"},
    {"action": "SliceObject", "object_id": "Apple|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11"},
    {"action": "PutObject", "object_id": "CounterTop|+01.00|+00.88|-01.11"}
]
